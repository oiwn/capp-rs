This is a collection of source code files from a project. Each file is separated by '---' delimiters.
The files include Git metadata showing their last modification details.

1. Focus on the architectural patterns used across files
2. Identify any potential code quality issues
3. Note the temporal relationship between changes using Git timestamps
4. Consider suggesting improvements while maintaining the existing design philosophy
